        and the Information We Collect<br>
        <b><span class="text1">Friendship Club </span></b>E-Friends is an online
        social networking community that connects people through networks of
        friends for dating or making new friends. To accomplish this, our users
        create their own profiles which are shown to the people in their
        personal network. A personal network consists of a user?s friends as
        well as the extended group of people that a user is connected to via
        chains of mutual friends. To fulfill the purpose of this site, some
        personal information we ask for is displayed to people within these
        personal networks.</p>

        any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally
        identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
        time of collection we will notify users via email.</p>
        <p class="text1">Invite a Friend</p>
        <p class="text1">If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a

        inviting them to join the site. <b><span class="text1">Friendship Club </span></b>
        E-Friends stores this email address for the purpose of automatically
        adding the respondant to the friends list of the user sending the
        invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. <b><span class="text1">Friendship

        disclose personal information online - for example on message boards,
